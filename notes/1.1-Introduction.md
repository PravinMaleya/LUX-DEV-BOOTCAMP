# Introduction to Data Science, Artificial Inteligence, and Machine Learning

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Is the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
Simulates human intelligence.

## Machine Learning (ML)
Is a subset of AI that deals with the training of models and algorithms with/from data, identify patterns, and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.

## Data Science
It involves extracting insights from data.
Also includes, collecting, cleaning, visualization and storing data.

## Importance of learning AI and Data Science:
- High demand for AI and data-related roles.
- Applications in various industries such as healthcare finance, tech, real estate among many others.
- To gain skills such as problem-solving, analytics, programming.
- To prepare for the future that is automation and AI-driven solutions.

## First code
```python
# This is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!"
print("Hello, World!")
