# 1.2 DATA TYPES & DATA STRUCTURES

## Common Datatypes
- Numeric Type
- Text Type
- Boolean Type
- Sequence Types
- Mapping Type
- Set Types
- Binary Types
- None Type

---

### i. Numeric Type
Used for representing numbers.

- **Integer (int)** – whole numbers (`1`, `2`, `3`)  
- **Float (float)** – decimal points (`3.0`, `2.4`, `3.7`)  
- **Complex (complex)** – numbers with real and imaginary parts (`3 + 2j`, `5j`)

---

### ii. Text Type
Used in text-based data types to hold a string of characters.

- **String (str)** – `"Hello world!"`

---

### iii. Boolean Type
They represent **true** or **false** values.

---

### iv. Sequence Types
Used for ordered collections of data.

- **List** – Used to store multiple items in a single variable.
- **Tuple** – Used to store multiple items in a single variable.
- **Range** – Immutable, used to store a sequence of numbers.

---

### v. Mapping Type
They store key-value pairs.

- **Dictionary (dict)** – Stores key:value pairs. Is a collection which is ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.

```python
thisdict = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25
}
```

---

### vi. Set Types
Set types are used to store multiple items in a single variable.  
They are collections that are:

- **Unordered:** Items do not have a defined order.  
- **Unchangeable:** Once a set is created, its items cannot be modified (though you can add or remove items).  
- **Unindexed:** Set items cannot be accessed by an index or key.

#### **Set (set)**
A collection of unique items.

```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)  # Output: {'apple', 'cherry', 'banana'}
```

---

### vii. Binary Types
Store data in byte-oriented format.

- **Bytes (bytes)**  
- **Byte Array (bytearray)**  
- **Memory View (memoryview)**

---

### viii. None Type
Represents the absence of values.

- **None Type (NoneType)**

```python
# Example of None type
x = None
print(x)  # Output: None

if x is None:
    print("x has no value")
```

---

## LISTS
List
Is a collection of items in a particular order. 

```python
# Creating Lists. Are mutable
my_list = [1,2,3,4,'cup','plate'] 

```
### Accessing Elements in a List
Index Positions start at 0 and not 1.
The first item in a list has an index of o, the second has an index of 2 and so forth.

```python
my_list[0] #output is 1
my_list[1] #output is 2
my_list[4] #output is 'cup'
my_list[5] #output is 'plate'

```

### Working with Lists
### Adding Elements to a List

```python
my_list = [1,2,3] 
my_list #output is 1,2,3

my_list.append(4) #append() is a method that adds an element to the end of the list
my_list #output is [1,2,3,4]

```

### Inserting Elements into a List

```python
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']

motorcycles.insert(0, 'kawasaki') #insert() is a method that adds an element at any position in your list.
print(motorcycles) # output is ['kawasaki', 'honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']

```

### Removing Elements from a List
 
### Using del

```python
motorcycles = ['kawasaki', 'honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print (motorcycles)  # output is ['kawasaki', 'honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']

del motorcycles[0] # del is a statement that deletes an element at any position in your list. Removes first item.
print(motorcycles) #output is ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']

motorcyles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']

del motorcycles[1]
print (motorcycles) # output is ['honda', 'suzuki']

```

### Using the pop() method
pop() method removes the last item in a list, but lets you work with that item after removing it.

```python
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles)

popped_motorcycle = motorcycles.pop()
print(motorcycles) #the residue after removing the last item
print(popped_motorcycle) #the removed item

```
Output:
    ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
    ['honda', 'yamaha']
    suzuki

You can also remove items from any position.

```python
first_owned = motorcycles.pop(0)
print (f"The first motorcycle I owned was a {first_owned.title()}.")
# Removed 'honda'
# title() is used to capitalize the first letter of the item.

```

Output:
    The first motorcycle I owned was a Honda. 

### Using remove() method
This is great for when you do not the position of the item but you know its value.

```python 
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']

motorcycles.remove('ducati')
print (motorcycles)

```

Output:
    ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki'] <!--'ducati' has been removed -->
