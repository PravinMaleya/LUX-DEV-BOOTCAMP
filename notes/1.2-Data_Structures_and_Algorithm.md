# 1.2 DATA TYPES, DATA STRUCTURES

## Common Datatypes
- Numeric Type
- Text Type
- Boolean Type
- Sequence Types
- Mapping Type
- Set Types
- Binary Types
- None Type

---

### i. Numeric Type
Used for representing numbers.

- **Integer (int)** – whole numbers (`1`, `2`, `3`)  
- **Float (float)** – decimal points (`3.0`, `2.4`, `3.7`)  
- **Complex (complex)** – numbers with real and imaginary parts (`3 + 2j`, `5j`)

---

### ii. Text Type
Used in text-based data types to hold a string of characters.

- **String (str)** – `"Hello world!"`

---

### iii. Boolean Type
They represent **true** or **false** values.

---

### iv. Sequence Types
Used for ordered collections of data.

- **List** – Used to store multiple items in a single variable.
- **Tuple** – Used to store multiple items in a single variable.
- **Range** – Immutable, used to store a sequence of numbers.

---

### v. Mapping Type
They store key-value pairs.

- **Dictionary (dict)** – Stores key:value pairs. Is a collection which is ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.

```python
thisdict = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25
}
```
---

### vi. Set Types
Set types are used to store multiple items in a single variable.  
They are collections that are:

- **Unordered:** Items do not have a defined order.  
- **Unchangeable:** Once a set is created, its items cannot be modified (though you can add or remove items).  
- **Unindexed:** Set items cannot be accessed by an index or key.

#### **Set (set)**
A collection of unique items.

```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)  # Output: {'apple', 'cherry', 'banana'}
```
### vii. Binary Types
Store data in byte-oriented format.

- **Bytes (bytes)**  
- **Byte Array (bytearray)**  
- **Memory View (memoryview)**

### viii. None Type
Represents the absence of values.

- **None Type (NoneType)**

```python
# Example of None type
x = None
print(x)  # Output: None

if x is None:
    print("x has no value")
```
