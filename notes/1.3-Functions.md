# 1.3 FUNCTIONS

Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. In this guide, we will go through various examples of functions in Python, including their definitions and how they can be used with and without arguments.

## Function Definition

A function in Python is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses. 

```python
def my_function(): # my_function is the function name
    print('Hello world!')
```

---

### Declaring and using Functions
Components to declaring a function:
- **Function Signature**
- **Function Body**
    
Here's a simple function definition:

```python
def lux_greeting():  # signature
    learning_structure = "long list of names"  # body 
    print(learning_structure)  # body
```

In this example, we define a function `lux_greeting` that prints a simple string. 

#### Calling the Function

To execute the function, we simply call it by its name:

```python
lux_greeting()  # calling the function. Output is long list of names
```

---

## Different types of Functions
There are two types of functions:
- **Functions with Arguments**
- **Functions without Arguments**

**Arguments** are values that are sent to the function when called. It is written in the parenthesis of the function name.
**Parameters** are variables listed inside the parenthesis of the function name.

### Functions without Arguments
We can also define a function without any arguments. Here's an example:

```python
def student():
    greet = "Hello student"
    print(greet)
```

In this case, the `student` function does not take any parameters and simply prints a greeting.

```python
student()  # The function can be called without passing any arguments hence the output is Hello Student
```

---

## Function With Arguments

Now, let's define a function that takes one argument:

```python
def student(name):
    greet = f"Hello {name} ,welcome to the class."
    print(greet)
```

Here, the function `student` takes the `name` parameter and prints a personalized greeting.

#### Calling the Function with an Argument

```python
student("John")  # Passing "John" as the argument. Output is Hello John ,welcome to class.
```

---

## Function With Multiple Arguments

A function can also accept multiple arguments. Here's an example where we pass both `name` and `age`:

```python
def student(name, age):
    greet = f"Hello {name}, welcome to the class. You are {age} years old."
    print(greet)
```

#### Calling the Function with Multiple Arguments

```python
student("Wendy", 20)  # Passing "Wendy" and "20" as arguments. Output is Hello Wendy, welcome to class. You are 20 years old.
```

---

## Different uses of functions

### Function to Perform Calculations

You can also define functions to perform calculations. For instance, here is a function to add two numbers:

```python
def calc(a, b):
    return a + b
```

#### Calling the Function to Perform a Calculation

```python
calc(2, 3)  # This will return 5, the sum of 2 and 3
```

## Working with Lists

You can also work with lists inside functions. For example, here's how to find the length of a list:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10]
len(my_list)  # This will return the length of the list. Output is 6
```

And here's how to find the sum of the list:

```python
sum(my_list)  # This will return the sum of all elements in the list. Output is 26
```

## Calculating the Average

Let's define a function that calculates the average of a list:

```python
def average(list):
    total_sum = sum(list)
    length = len(list)
    return total_sum / length
```

#### Calling the Average Function

```python
average(my_list)  # This will calculate the average of the elements in the list above. Output is 4.33333
```

## Function to Check Even Numbers

Functions can also be used to perform condition-based checks. Here's a function that checks whether numbers in a list are even or odd:

```python
def even_greetings(list):
    for number in list:
        if number % 2 == 0:  # conditional statement
            print(f"{number} is an even number")
        else:
            print(f"{number} is an odd number")
```

#### Calling the Even Check Function

```python
even_greetings(my_list)  # This will check each number in the list and print if it is even or odd.
```

Output is 
1 is an odd number
2 is an even number
3 is an odd number
4 is an even number
6 is an even number
10 is an even number

In this guide, we've covered the basics of functions in Python, from defining functions without arguments to more complex examples with multiple arguments and calculations. Functions are a powerful tool in programming, allowing for reusable and modular code.

    length = len(list)
    return total_sum / length

#### Calling the Average Function

            print(f"{number} is an even number")
        else:
            print(f"{number} is an odd number")
```

#### Calling the Even Check Function

```python
even_greetings(my_list)  # This will check each number in the list and print if it is even or odd.
```

Output is 
1 is an odd number

3 is an odd number
4 is an even number
6 is an even number
10 is an even number
