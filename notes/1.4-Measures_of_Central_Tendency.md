# MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY

These are statistical values that represent the center value of a dataset. They help summarize data by identifying a single value that best describes the entire dataset.

The three main measures of central tendency are:

- Mean
- Median
- Mode

## 1. MEAN / AVERAGE

The mean is the sum of all values divided by the total number of values.

**Formula:**

```
Mean = (Total sum of all values) / (Total number of values)
```

## 2. MEDIAN

The median is the middle value in a dataset ordered from low to high.

- If there is an odd number of values, the median is the middle one.
- If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

**Example:**

- Odd dataset: `[3, 5, 8]` - Median = `5`
- Even dataset: `[2, 4, 5, 7, 6, 8]` – Median = `(5 + 7) / 2 = 6`

**Using index/position in a list:**

```
Median = (Total number of datasets (N) + 1) / 2
```

**Example:** `[13, 21, 21, 40, 42, 48, 55, 72]`

```
N = 8
(8 + 1) / 2 = 4.5
```

Index for the median is the 4th and 5th values: `40` and `42`.

```
Median = (40 + 42) / 2 = 41
```

## 3. MODE

The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the dataset. A dataset can have:

- One mode (Unimodal).
- More than one mode (Bimodal or Multimodal).

# MEASURES OF DISPERSION

Dispersion refers to the extent to which data values spread out or vary around a central value (such as mean or median). It helps in understanding how scattered or consistent the data is.

Measures of dispersion include:

- Absolute Deviation
- Standard Deviation
- Variance

## 1. ABSOLUTE DEVIATION

Absolute deviation is the difference between a value in a dataset and the mean. It is always positive because it shows how the points deviate from the mean regardless of direction.

The **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)** is the average absolute difference from the mean.

**Formula:**

```
MAD = (Absolute Deviation) / N
```

## 2. RANGE

The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values.

**Formula:**

```
Range = Max – Min
```

## 3. VARIANCE

Variance is the average squared difference from the mean.

## 4. STANDARD DEVIATION

Standard deviation is the square root of variance, indicating average deviation.

# QUANTILES, QUARTILES, AND PERCENTILES

Quantiles split data into equal-sized intervals. They include:

- Quartiles
- Percentiles

## 1. QUARTILES

Quartiles divide the dataset into four equal parts:

- **Q1 (First Quartile, 25th percentile)** – 25% of data falls below this point.
- **Q2 (Second Quartile, 50th percentile / Median)** – 50% of data falls below this point.
- **Q3 (Third Quartile, 75th percentile)** – 75% of data falls below this point.

## 2. PERCENTILES

Percentiles divide data into 100 equal parts and help determine the rank of a value in a dataset.

- **P25 (25th percentile) = Q1**
- **P50 (50th percentile) = Q2 (Median)**
- **P75 (75th percentile) = Q3**

## CALCULATION FOR FINDING QUARTILES AND PERCENTILES

## Finding Quartiles:

1. Arrange the dataset in ascending order.
2. Identify the quartile position using the formula:

```
Qk = k * (N + 1) / 4
```

Where `k` is the quartile number (1, 2, or 3) and `N` is the total number of values. 3. If the position is an integer, select that indexed value. 4. If the position is a decimal, take the average of the two closest values.

## Finding Percentiles:

1. Arrange the dataset in ascending order.
2. Determine the percentile position using the formula:

```
Pk = k * (N + 1) / 100
```

Where `k` is the percentile rank. 3. If the position is an integer, select that indexed value. 4. If the position is a decimal, take the average of the two closest values.
